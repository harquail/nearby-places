#Sample Project Details

##Objective: Build a simple location-aware iOS app that pulls data from an HTTP API.
 
Using the Google Places API (https://developers.google.com/places/documentation/) build an app that provides the following functionality:
 
Present a list of places near the user using the Places API.

The app should also do one of the following things (bonus for both):
Show images for the places in line.
Load the next page of results when the user scrolls to the bottom of the list. 
 
The focus of the project should be on producing clean, professional-quality code and demonstrating familiarity with the platform APIs and best practices.

*If you use any libraries please include a quick note with your email explaining why you used them.* 

## Cocoapods used

* GoogleKit (DanielyBotelho's branch): wrapper for Google Places API; makes it easier to fetch places and place photos 
* SDWebImage: asyncronously load images
